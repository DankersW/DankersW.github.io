## Saent box

Company: Memory X design Beijing, China
link: https://memory.partners/projects/saent-box
Technologies: Java, Prototyping, Mobile app

An analog solution to a digital problem.

Place The Box over your phone and get back to what’s essential. No more phubbing (when someone looks at their phone instead of you). No more mindless scrolling when you’re supposed to be working. The clear monolithic form can hold three phones to work in a team or family setting.

The Saent box challenges the traditional globalized manufacturing model by using in-market-specific materials and production partners.

Local woods are sourced and milled by a selected partner, within the specific market. This approach eliminates all international shipping associated with the product. (International shipping is responsible for 18% of some air pollutants.)

This box is machined on a standard two-axis mill from a solid block of pine in East Tamaki, before being hand-finished and shipped to a local customer. While in Canada our Quebec manufacturer sources Douglas Fir for production, before finishing and distributing the product.

The simple design enables us to use easily accessible local materials and processes while giving each product its own local provenance. The approach limits the environmental impact while distributing returns into local industries.

I created the Saent box prototype during my internship. My goal was to prototyped the next phase of the customers product road-map.

## Brönnöy

Company: Volvo Autonomous Sollutions, Göteborg, Sweden
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4wLPfOz-c4&t=83s
Technology: C++, Robotics, wireless communication, Embedded linux, Agile

First commecial availible automomous sollution. The solution for Brønnøy Kalk AS consists of autonomous hub-to-hub solution transporting limestone in Velfjord, Norway. The autonomous Volvo FH trucks are managed by the operator of a wheel loader. The 5km long route includes driving in both tunnels and outdoor environment.

I was an developer and scrum master in the agile release train who conceptualized and developed this project. My part was building up the connectivity infrastructure as well as the advanged logging plaform handling data form the base vehicle, the automonous drive components, as well as the surroundings.

## CI-CD platform

Company: Volvo group Technology
Technology: Python, Kafka, Docker, Micro-services

Redesigned how Bitbucket events triggerJenkins jobs, and how the CI-CD chain is build-up. Kafka was used as a message queue between several created Dockerized micro services written in Python that were spread out over the Volvo network. I designed the system from a conceptional idea to a production ready implementation. The project is used by the verification department of the Volvo group Connectivity department.
